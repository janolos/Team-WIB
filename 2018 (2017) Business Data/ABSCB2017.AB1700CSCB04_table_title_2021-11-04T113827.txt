<p>The Census Bureau has reviewed this data product for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and has approved the disclosure avoidance practices applied (Approval ID: CBDRB-FY20-008).</p>

<p><b>Release Schedule:</b><br />
Data in this file come from estimates of business ownership by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status from the 2018 Annual Business Survey (ABS) collection. Data are also obtained from administrative records, the 2017 Economic Census and other economic surveys.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> The collection year is the year in which the data are collected. A reference year is the year that is referenced in the questions on the survey and in which the statistics are tabulated. For example, the 2018 ABS collection year produces statistics for the 2017 reference year. The "Year" column in the table is the reference year. The ABS has a larger sample size during the benchmark year of 2017. Due to the larger size, more detailed data are shown for reference year 2017.</p>

<p><b>Key Table Information:</b><br />
This is one of four tables in the ABS series to provide select economic and demographic characteristics of businesses (CB) for U.S. employer firms that reported the sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for up to four persons owning the largest percentage(s) of the business. Includes U.S. firms with paid employees, operating during the reference year with receipts of $1,000 or more, which are classified in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), Sectors 11 through 99, except for NAICS 111, 112, 482, 491, 521, 525, 813, 814, and 92 which are not covered. Employer firms with more than one domestic establishment are counted in each geographic area and industry in which they operate, but only once in the U.S. and state totals for all sectors. Firms are asked to report their employees as of the March 12 pay period.</p>

	</li>
        <li>Unclassifiable (firms not classifiable by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status)</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Data are further aggregated by employment size of firms (during the March 12 pay period) for:

    <li>Firms with 20 to 49 employees</li>
    <li>Firms with 50 to 99 employees</li>
    <li>Firms with 100 to 249 employees</li>
    <li>Firms with 250 to 499 employees</li>
    <li>Firms with 500 employees or more</li>
</ul></p>

<p><i>Data Notes:</i>
<ol>
    <li>Business ownership is defined as having 51 percent or more of the stock or equity in the business. Data are provided for businesses owned equally (50% / 50%) by men and women, by Hispanics and non-Hispanics, by minorities and nonminorities, and by veterans and nonveterans.</li>
    <li>The detail may not add to the total or subgroup total because a Hispanic or Latino firm may be of any race, and because a firm could be tabulated in more than one racial group. For example, if a firm responded as both Chinese and Black majority owned, the firm would be included in the detailed Asian and Black estimates but would only be counted once toward the higher level all firms' estimates.</li>
    <li>References such as "Mexican-owned," "Puerto Rican-owned," "Cuban-owned" or "other Hispanic- or Latino-owned" businesses refer only to businesses operating in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that self-identified 51 percent or more of their ownership in 2017 to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin. The ABS does not distinguish between U.S. residents and nonresidents. Companies owned by foreign governments or owned by other companies, foreign or domestic, are included in the category "Unclassifiable."</li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>Business Characteristics:</b><br />
The ABS was designed to include select questions about business characteristics from multiple reference periods and to incorporate new content each survey year based on topics of relevance.</p>

<p>Respondent firms include all firms that responded to the characteristics tabulated in this dataset and reported sex, ethnicity, race, or veteran status, or that were not classifiable by sex, ethnicity, race, or veteran status. Percentages are for respondent firms only and are not recalculated when the dataset is resorted. Percentages are always based on total reporting (defined above) within a sex, ethnicity, race, veteran status, and/or industry group for the characteristics tabulated in this dataset.</p>
